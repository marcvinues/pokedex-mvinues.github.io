# WIP Pokedex
## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd vinues-app
npm i
npm run dev
```

For production environments...
```sh
npm run build
```
#### What?: 
We use React and Typescript to create a project with multiple components, those components are reusable.

We fetch data using axios also we can do with fetch native but considering the manage of errors with axios I thot it was a good idea.
